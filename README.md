 # WINDOWS
 
 Enter the bin folder in your FSA folder
 It should be empty. 

Run the following commands depending on the Command line interface you are using. 
Command prompt: cmake ..\
Power Shell: cmake ..\
Git Bash: cmake ../

This will generate solution files if you are using Visual Studios as your generator
(To learn more about generators https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-generators.7.html)

If you have an .sln file in the bin directory go ahead and click on it and open it up with Visual Studios. 
There you will hit Build which will create the dynamic library in your bin directory!
